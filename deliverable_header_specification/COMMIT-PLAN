# COMMIT PLAN — DELIVERABLE HEADER SPECIFICATION UPDATE

## PURPOSE

This commit plan defines a controlled, auditable sequence of commits to
correct the Deliverable Header specification so that it accurately
reflects a directory-scoped artifact model.

The plan exists to ensure that ontology corrections are applied
mechanically, without inference, drift, or accidental expansion of
scope.


## SCOPE OF CHANGE

This plan governs changes to the Deliverable Header specification only.

The scope includes:
• Correcting embedded-header assumptions
• Making directory-scoped artifact identity explicit
• Defining header placement and discovery structurally
• Removing language that implies artifact body parsing

No other specifications, grammars, invariants, protocols, or placement
rules are modified by this plan.


## IN-SCOPE ASSUMPTIONS

The following assumptions are explicitly declared and binding for this
plan:

• Deliverable artifacts are directory-scoped units.
• Each artifact directory contains exactly one deliverable header.
• The deliverable header exists as a standalone file named `HEADER.txt`.
• Header discovery is performed by deterministic filename lookup.
• Artifact bodies are opaque and MUST NOT be parsed for metadata.
• Existing header fields retain their semantic intent as declarative
  fact surfaces only.

These assumptions are treated as explicit truth for the duration of
this plan.


## OUT-OF-SCOPE ASSUMPTIONS

The following topics are explicitly out of scope and MUST NOT be
introduced during execution:

• Naming grammar changes
• Artifact body naming rules
• Enforcement mechanisms or tooling behavior
• Orchestration logic
• Repository topology changes
• Migration strategies beyond acknowledgment
• Reservation of structural tokens beyond escalation notes
• Convenience or backward-compatibility accommodations

Any requirement touching these areas MUST halt execution and trigger a
separate design pass.


## COMMIT SEQUENCE OVERVIEW

This plan is executed as a linear sequence of self-contained commits.

Each commit:
• Has a single responsibility
• Introduces no hidden dependencies
• Can be reviewed and reasoned about in isolation

Later commits MUST NOT rely on unstated intent from earlier commits.


## COMMIT 1 — HEADER INITIALIZATION

Initialize a standalone `HEADER.txt` file for the Deliverable Header
specification.

This commit:
• Establishes the artifact’s structural presence in GitHub
• Uses best-effort, non-committal identity values
• Leaves unresolved fields explicitly marked as placeholders

No specification content is introduced in this commit.


## COMMIT 2 — ONTOLOGY CORRECTION (DIRECTORY-SCOPED MODEL)

Introduce explicit language defining deliverable artifacts as
directory-scoped identity units rather than single files.

This commit:

• Corrects the implicit file-scoped artifact ontology
• Declares that a deliverable artifact is a directory-scoped unit
• Clarifies that `ARTIFACT_ID` identifies the artifact itself
• Establishes that `ARTIFACT_ID` determines both:
  – the artifact directory name
  – the artifact body filename within that directory
• Makes no changes to header structure, discovery, or filenames
• Makes no changes to header field definitions

This commit introduces ontology clarification only and intentionally
does not define header placement, structural filenames, or discovery
rules.

## COMMIT 3 — HEADER STRUCTURE & DISCOVERY RULES

Define the structural placement and discovery model for deliverable
headers.

This commit:
• Specifies `HEADER.txt` as a fixed structural filename
• States that headers are standalone artifacts
• Prohibits parsing of artifact body content for header discovery
• Defines loud failure conditions for missing or ambiguous headers

No enforcement mechanisms are introduced.


## COMMIT 4 — EMBEDDED-HEADER LANGUAGE REMOVAL

Remove or correct all language in the specification that assumes an
embedded-header model.

This commit:
• Eliminates references to textual header boundaries
• Removes language implying header/body cohabitation
• Removes parsing-oriented phrasing
• Preserves original semantic intent where applicable

This commit is corrective and subtractive only.


## COMMIT 5 — SANITY & CONTINUITY CHECK

Perform an internal coherence check on the updated specification.

This commit:
• Verifies consistency across sections
• Confirms no conflicting assumptions remain
• Introduces no new concepts or rules
• Makes no structural changes

This is a validation-only pass.


## COMMIT 6 — FORMATTING PASS

Apply formatting and presentation cleanup.

This commit:
• Improves readability only
• Does not modify meaning or scope
• Does not alter ontology or rules

Correctness MUST already be resolved before this commit.


## FINAL COMMIT — HEADER FINALIZATION

Finalize all deliverable header fields.

This commit:
• Resolves placeholder values
• Binds final identity and context
• Marks the artifact as complete and deployable

No further mutation occurs without a new lifecycle iteration.


## EXECUTION NOTES

Execution of this plan MUST follow the Human-Mediated Mechanical
Application (HMMA) process.

All changes MUST be applied verbatim as emitted.
Any ambiguity, mismatch, or conflict MUST halt execution immediately.


## STOP CONDITIONS

Execution MUST STOP if:

• A required change exceeds the declared scope
• A conflict with another specification is discovered
• An unstated assumption becomes necessary
• Mechanical execution cannot be performed exactly
• A decision is required that is not explicitly declared

Stopping is the correct outcome in all such cases.
