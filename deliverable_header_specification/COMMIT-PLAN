# COMMIT PLAN — DELIVERABLE HEADER SPECIFICATION UPDATE

## PURPOSE

This commit plan defines a controlled, auditable sequence of commits to
correct the Deliverable Header specification so that it accurately
reflects a directory-scoped artifact model.

The plan exists to ensure that ontology corrections are applied
mechanically, without inference, drift, or accidental expansion of
scope.


## SCOPE OF CHANGE

This plan governs changes to the Deliverable Header specification only.

The scope includes:
• Correcting embedded-header assumptions
• Making directory-scoped artifact identity explicit
• Defining header placement and discovery structurally
• Removing language that implies artifact body parsing

No other specifications, grammars, invariants, protocols, or placement
rules are modified by this plan.


## IN-SCOPE ASSUMPTIONS

The following assumptions are explicitly declared and binding for this
plan:

• Deliverable artifacts are directory-scoped units.
• Each artifact directory contains exactly one deliverable header.
• The deliverable header exists as a standalone file named `HEADER.txt`.
• Header discovery is performed by deterministic filename lookup.
• Artifact bodies are opaque and MUST NOT be parsed for metadata.
• Existing header fields retain their semantic intent as declarative
  fact surfaces only.

These assumptions are treated as explicit truth for the duration of
this plan.


## OUT-OF-SCOPE ASSUMPTIONS

The following topics are explicitly out of scope and MUST NOT be
introduced during execution:

• Naming grammar changes
• Artifact body naming rules
• Enforcement mechanisms or tooling behavior
• Orchestration logic
• Repository topology changes
• Migration strategies beyond acknowledgment
• Reservation of structural tokens beyond escalation notes
• Convenience or backward-compatibility accommodations

Any requirement touching these areas MUST halt execution and trigger a
separate design pass.


## COMMIT SEQUENCE OVERVIEW

This plan is executed as a linear sequence of self-contained commits.

Each commit:
• Has a single responsibility
• Introduces no hidden dependencies
• Can be reviewed and reasoned about in isolation

Later commits MUST NOT rely on unstated intent from earlier commits.


## COMMIT 1 — HEADER INITIALIZATION

Initialize a standalone `HEADER.txt` file for the Deliverable Header
specification.

This commit:
• Establishes the artifact’s structural presence in GitHub
• Uses best-effort, non-committal identity values
• Leaves unresolved fields explicitly marked as placeholders

No specification content is introduced in this commit.


## COMMIT 2 — ONTOLOGY CORRECTION (DIRECTORY-SCOPED MODEL)

Introduce explicit language defining deliverable artifacts as
directory-scoped identity units rather than single files.

This commit:

• Corrects the implicit file-scoped artifact ontology
• Declares that a deliverable artifact is a directory-scoped unit
• Clarifies that `ARTIFACT_ID` identifies the artifact itself
• Establishes that `ARTIFACT_ID` determines both:
  – the artifact directory name
  – the artifact body filename within that directory
• Makes no changes to header structure, discovery, or filenames
• Makes no changes to header field definitions

This commit introduces ontology clarification only and intentionally
does not define header placement, structural filenames, or discovery
rules.

## COMMIT 3 — HEADER STRUCTURE & DISCOVERY (STRUCTURAL HEADER FILE)

Define the structural placement and discovery model for deliverable
headers within directory-scoped artifacts.

This commit:

• Declares `HEADER.txt` as a fixed, structural filename
• Specifies that exactly one `HEADER.txt` MUST exist per artifact directory
• States that the deliverable header is a standalone structural file
• Prohibits embedding headers within artifact body content
• Prohibits parsing or inspecting artifact body files for header discovery
• Defines loud structural failure when `HEADER.txt` is missing,
  duplicated, or ambiguous

This commit defines header structure and discovery only.
It does not modify artifact identity, directory structure,
naming grammar, or enforcement mechanisms.

## COMMIT 4 — EMBEDDED-HEADER LANGUAGE REMOVAL

Remove or correct all language in the specification that assumes an
embedded-header model.

This commit:
• Eliminates references to textual header boundaries
• Removes language implying header/body cohabitation
• Removes parsing-oriented phrasing
• Preserves original semantic intent where applicable

This commit is corrective and subtractive only.


<COMMIT_TASK>

## COMMIT 6 — SPECIFICATION IDENTITY RENAME

Rename the Deliverable Header specification to
“Artifact Identity Record Specification”.

This commit:
• Renames the document title and internal self-references only
• Does not rename files, tags, or structural elements
• Introduces no semantic, structural, or behavioral changes
• Preserves all existing rules and constraints verbatim

This commit is a naming correction only.
It establishes correct ontology for subsequent changes.

</COMMIT_TASK>

<COMMIT_TASK>

## COMMIT 7 — STRUCTURAL FILE RENAME (HEADER.txt → IDENTITY.txt)

Rename the structural file used to store artifact identity information
from HEADER.txt to IDENTITY.txt.

This commit:
• Replaces all references to HEADER.txt with IDENTITY.txt
• Clarifies that IDENTITY.txt is a required structural artifact
• Introduces no new fields or rules
• Does not alter placement grammar or enforcement semantics

This commit is structural and declarative only.

</COMMIT_TASK>

<COMMIT_TASK>

## COMMIT 8 — ENVELOPE TAG RENAME (<DELIVERABLE_HEADER> → <IDENTITY>)

Rename the identity envelope tags used within the structural file.

This commit:
• Replaces <DELIVERABLE_HEADER> / </DELIVERABLE_HEADER>
  with <IDENTITY> / </IDENTITY>
• Makes no changes to field names, ordering, or meaning
• Introduces no new validation or enforcement logic

This commit removes residual “header” semantics at the syntax level.

</COMMIT_TASK>

<COMMIT_TASK>

## COMMIT 9 — TERMINOLOGY CONSOLIDATION (HEADER → IDENTITY)

Eliminate remaining conceptual use of “header” terminology in favor of
“identity record”.

This commit:
• Updates descriptive language, section titles, and prose
• Removes conceptual framing that implies header/body relationships
• Preserves all normative requirements unchanged

This commit is linguistic and clarificatory only.

</COMMIT_TASK>

<COMMIT_TASK>

## COMMIT 10 — REDUNDANT DEFENSIVE LANGUAGE PRUNING

Remove defensive language that is no longer necessary after the
identity-record model is established.

This commit:
• Removes prohibitions whose misuse is now structurally impossible
• Preserves all invariants and failure conditions
• Introduces no new permissions or relaxations

This commit tightens the specification without changing behavior.

</COMMIT_TASK>

<COMMIT_TASK>

## COMMIT 11 — FINAL COHERENCE & ONTOLOGY CHECK

Perform a final coherence pass on the renamed and refactored
specification.

This commit:
• Verifies internal consistency of terminology and scope
• Confirms no orphaned “header” semantics remain
• Introduces no new rules, structures, or concepts

This commit is validation-only.

</COMMIT_TASK>

## COMMIT N — FORMATTING PASS

Apply formatting and presentation cleanup.

This commit:
• Improves readability only
• Does not modify meaning or scope
• Does not alter ontology or rules

Correctness MUST already be resolved before this commit.


## FINAL COMMIT — HEADER FINALIZATION

Finalize all deliverable header fields.

This commit:
• Resolves placeholder values
• Binds final identity and context
• Marks the artifact as complete and deployable

No further mutation occurs without a new lifecycle iteration.


## EXECUTION NOTES

Execution of this plan MUST follow the Human-Mediated Mechanical
Application (HMMA) process.

All changes MUST be applied verbatim as emitted.
Any ambiguity, mismatch, or conflict MUST halt execution immediately.


## STOP CONDITIONS

Execution MUST STOP if:

• A required change exceeds the declared scope
• A conflict with another specification is discovered
• An unstated assumption becomes necessary
• Mechanical execution cannot be performed exactly
• A decision is required that is not explicitly declared

Stopping is the correct outcome in all such cases.
