# COMMIT PLAN — DELIVERABLE_HEADER_SPECIFICATION ONLY
# (BROKEN INTO SMALL, OBVIOUS, HUMAN-EXECUTABLE COMMITS)

# ============================================================
# COMMIT 1 — Add ARTIFACT_DOMAIN field definition
# ============================================================

WHAT THIS COMMIT DOES (ONLY):
- Introduce ARTIFACT_DOMAIN as a REQUIRED header field
- Define its purpose as canonical repository selection
- Explicitly refuse authority, ownership, lifecycle, or ordering semantics

FILES TOUCHED:
- DELIVERABLE_HEADER_SPECIFICATION

WHY THE DIFF IS OBVIOUS:
- One new field section is added
- No existing fields are modified
- No examples are changed

COMMIT MESSAGE:
Add ARTIFACT_DOMAIN to DELIVERABLE_HEADER_SPECIFICATION


# ============================================================
# COMMIT 2 — Add ARTIFACT_ID field definition
# ============================================================

WHAT THIS COMMIT DOES (ONLY):
- Introduce ARTIFACT_ID as a REQUIRED header field
- Define it as the stable, opaque identity of a specific artifact
- State that ARTIFACT_ID is the sole source of truth for filename derivation
- Explicitly refuse semantic, authority, lifecycle, or status meaning

FILES TOUCHED:
- DELIVERABLE_HEADER_SPECIFICATION

WHY THE DIFF IS OBVIOUS:
- One new field section is added
- No routing grammar or examples are changed yet

COMMIT MESSAGE:
Add ARTIFACT_ID to DELIVERABLE_HEADER_SPECIFICATION


# ============================================================
# COMMIT 3 — Clarify ARTIFACT_FUNCTION scope (de-overload)
# ============================================================

WHAT THIS COMMIT DOES (ONLY):
- Update the existing ARTIFACT_FUNCTION definition
- Explicitly state that it describes role / kind only
- Explicitly prohibit its use for identity or filename derivation

FILES TOUCHED:
- DELIVERABLE_HEADER_SPECIFICATION

WHY THE DIFF IS OBVIOUS:
- Only the ARTIFACT_FUNCTION section is edited
- No new fields are added
- No examples are changed

COMMIT MESSAGE:
Clarify ARTIFACT_FUNCTION as role descriptor only


# ============================================================
# COMMIT 4 — Document deterministic placement grammar
# ============================================================

WHAT THIS COMMIT DOES (ONLY):
- Add or update a short section describing deterministic placement
- State the mapping explicitly:
    ARTIFACT_DOMAIN   → repository
    ARTIFACT_FUNCTION → path class
    ARTIFACT_ID       → filename
    ARTIFACT_FORMAT   → extension

FILES TOUCHED:
- DELIVERABLE_HEADER_SPECIFICATION

WHY THE DIFF IS OBVIOUS:
- One explanatory section is added or updated
- No field definitions are changed

COMMIT MESSAGE:
Document deterministic placement grammar in header specification


# ============================================================
# COMMIT 5 — Update header template example
# ============================================================

WHAT THIS COMMIT DOES (ONLY):
- Update the example <DELIVERABLE_HEADER> block
- Add the following fields to the template:
    ARTIFACT_DOMAIN:
    ARTIFACT_ID:

FILES TOUCHED:
- DELIVERABLE_HEADER_SPECIFICATION

WHY THE DIFF IS OBVIOUS:
- Only the example header block changes
- No prose or field definitions are modified

COMMIT MESSAGE:
Update header template to include ARTIFACT_DOMAIN and ARTIFACT_ID


# ============================================================
# EXECUTION NOTES
# ============================================================

- Each commit is independently reviewable and reversible
- You may stop after any commit and remain in a valid state
- No downstream artifacts are touched
- No migration or normalization is implied
- Scope is strictly limited to the header specification

# POST–COMMIT 5 EXTENSION — DELIVERABLE_HEADER_SPECIFICATION

# ============================================================
# NON-COMMIT — Sanity Check #1 (Consistency Review)
# ============================================================

PURPOSE:
- Perform a human reasoning pass over the current
  DELIVERABLE_HEADER_SPECIFICATION
- Verify internal consistency only:
  • Field definitions do not contradict one another
  • Required fields match the header template
  • Deterministic placement mapping aligns with field meanings
  • Style guidance does not introduce semantic implications

RULES:
- No edits
- No commits
- No artifact changes
- Notes may be recorded externally only

OUTPUT:
- Proceed or identify issues before formatting changes


# ============================================================
# COMMIT 6 — Normalize Content (Formatting Only)
# ============================================================

SCOPE:
- Formatting, spacing, and layout normalization
- Whitespace cleanup
- Bullet and list consistency
- Section and heading alignment (readability only)
- Re-order field sections to match the order of the fields in the example

EXPLICITLY FORBIDDEN:
- Changing semantic meaning
- Adding or removing sentences
- Renaming fields
- Rewording definitions
- Tightening or loosening constraints
- Adding examples or guidance

LITMUS TEST:
- A reviewer may conclude “this is clearer or cleaner to read”
- A reviewer must NOT conclude “this says something new”

COMMIT MESSAGE:
Normalize formatting in DELIVERABLE_HEADER_SPECIFICATION


# ============================================================
# NON-COMMIT — Sanity Check #2 (Post-Normalization)
# ============================================================

PURPOSE:
- Verify Commit 6 introduced zero semantic drift
- Re-read as a first-time reader
- Confirm:
  • No accidental emphasis or implication was introduced
  • Constraints remain explicit
  • Header remains a fact surface, not a decision surface

RULES:
- No edits
- No commits
- No artifact changes

OUTPUT:
- Confirm readiness for self-reemission


# ============================================================
# COMMIT 7 — Reemit Specification Header (Self-Compliance)
# ============================================================

PURPOSE:
- Update the deliverable_header_specification’s own header
  to fully comply with the canonical DELIVERABLE_HEADER_SPECIFICATION
- Values remain blank prior to deployment

SCOPE:
- Header only
- Body content remains untouched

REQUIREMENTS:
- All required header fields present
- COLLABORATION field included only if warranted

EXPLICITLY FORBIDDEN:
- Body edits
- Semantic changes
- Retroactive reinterpretation

COMMIT MESSAGE:
Reemit deliverable_header_specification header to match canonical format
