    ARTIFACT_DOMAIN:
    ARTIFACT_ID:

FILES TOUCHED:
- DELIVERABLE_HEADER_SPECIFICATION

WHY THE DIFF IS OBVIOUS:

# ============================================================
# EXECUTION NOTES
# ============================================================

- Each commit is independently reviewable and reversible
- You may stop after any commit and remain in a valid state
- No downstream artifacts are touched
- No migration or normalization is implied
- Scope is strictly limited to the header specification

# POST–COMMIT 5 EXTENSION — DELIVERABLE_HEADER_SPECIFICATION

# ============================================================
# NON-COMMIT — Sanity Check #1 (Consistency Review)
# ============================================================

PURPOSE:
- Perform a human reasoning pass over the current
  DELIVERABLE_HEADER_SPECIFICATION
- Verify internal consistency only:
  • Field definitions do not contradict one another
  • Required fields match the header template
  • Deterministic placement mapping aligns with field meanings
  • Style guidance does not introduce semantic implications

RULES:
- No edits
- No commits
- No artifact changes
- Notes may be recorded externally only

OUTPUT:
- Proceed or identify issues before formatting changes


# ============================================================
# COMMIT 6 — Normalize Content (Formatting Only)
# ============================================================

SCOPE:
- Formatting, spacing, and layout normalization
- Whitespace cleanup
- Bullet and list consistency
- Section and heading alignment (readability only)
- Re-order field sections to match the order of the fields in the example

EXPLICITLY FORBIDDEN:
- Changing semantic meaning
- Adding or removing sentences
- Renaming fields
- Rewording definitions
- Tightening or loosening constraints
- Adding examples or guidance

LITMUS TEST:
- A reviewer may conclude “this is clearer or cleaner to read”
- A reviewer must NOT conclude “this says something new”

COMMIT MESSAGE:
Normalize formatting in DELIVERABLE_HEADER_SPECIFICATION


# ============================================================
# NON-COMMIT — Sanity Check #2 (Post-Normalization)
# ============================================================

PURPOSE:
- Verify Commit 6 introduced zero semantic drift
- Re-read as a first-time reader
- Confirm:
  • No accidental emphasis or implication was introduced
  • Constraints remain explicit
  • Header remains a fact surface, not a decision surface

RULES:
- No edits
- No commits
- No artifact changes

OUTPUT:
- Confirm readiness for self-reemission


# ============================================================
# COMMIT 7 — Reemit Specification Header (Self-Compliance)
# ============================================================

PURPOSE:
- Update the deliverable_header_specification’s own header
  to fully comply with the canonical DELIVERABLE_HEADER_SPECIFICATION
- Values remain blank prior to deployment

SCOPE:
- Header only
- Body content remains untouched

REQUIREMENTS:
- All required header fields present
- COLLABORATION field included only if warranted

EXPLICITLY FORBIDDEN:
- Body edits
- Semantic changes
- Retroactive reinterpretation


COMMIT 8 — Clarify Human vs Machine Interpretation of Header Fields
------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE:
Introduce an explicit audience distinction clarifying how header field
constraints apply to tooling versus human authors.

RATIONALE:
The specification currently describes header fields as opaque and
non-semantic without explicitly stating that this constraint applies to
machine interpretation. This can mislead human authors into believing
they must avoid meaningful judgment when selecting values.

SCOPE:
- Add a short, explicit “Human vs Machine Interpretation” paragraph
  near the top of the specification (after Purpose or as its own
  clearly labeled subsection).
- No changes to individual field definitions.
- No changes to placement grammar, invariants, or examples.

NON-GOALS:
- No semantic changes to any field.
- No new requirements or enforcement mechanisms.
- No rewording of ARTIFACT_ID or ARTIFACT_FUNCTION.

COMMIT MESSAGE (candidate):
Clarify human vs machine interpretation of header fields



COMMIT 9 — Reframe ARTIFACT_ID as Human-Chosen, Machine-Opaque
--------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE:
Reword the ARTIFACT_ID definition to make human responsibility explicit
while preserving strict machine opacity and non-inferential treatment.

RATIONALE:
Leading with “opaque and non-semantic” is technically correct but
miscommunicates intent to human readers. ARTIFACT_ID values are chosen
by humans for clarity and reference; the constraint is that machines
must not interpret or infer meaning from them.

SCOPE:
- Modify the ARTIFACT_ID definition text only.
- Emphasize:
  • human selection
  • stability
  • machine non-interpretation
- Preserve all existing constraints (no authority, no behavior, no
  lifecycle semantics).

NON-GOALS:
- No change to placement rules.
- No change to filename derivation.
- No change to required/optional status.
- No renaming of the field.

COMMIT MESSAGE (candidate):
Reframe ARTIFACT_ID as human-chosen, machine-opaque identifier



COMMIT 10 — Clarify ARTIFACT_FUNCTION as Path Classifier
-------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE:
Align the ARTIFACT_FUNCTION definition with its actual role in
deterministic routing as clarified by GOV – Archivist.

RATIONALE:
ARTIFACT_FUNCTION has been misread as a behavioral or descriptive field.
It is, in fact, a placement-critical path classifier selected by a human
author and used by tooling solely to determine directory placement.

SCOPE:
- Reword the ARTIFACT_FUNCTION definition text.
- Make explicit that:
  • it is selected by a human
  • it classifies artifacts for placement
  • it does not describe behavior, usage, or lifecycle
- Ensure consistency with the deterministic placement grammar.

NON-GOALS:
- No change to routing mechanics.
- No new placement rules.
- No semantic expansion beyond clarification.
- No changes to ARTIFACT_GROUP.

COMMIT MESSAGE (candidate):
Clarify ARTIFACT_FUNCTION as human-selected path classifier

COMMIT MESSAGE:
Reemit deliverable_header_specification header to match canonical format
