EXPLANATION

Deliverable Header Specification — Canonical Definition

Purpose  
This artifact defines the required header structure and fields for
deliverable artifacts.

The header exists to make provenance, identity, expression, association,
and situational context explicit, while deliberately refusing to encode
authority, lifecycle, ordering, evaluation, or temporal semantics.

────────────────────────────────────────
APPLICABILITY
────────────────────────────────────────

This specification applies only to artifacts designated as deliverables
within a delegated execution scope.

It does not replace or override:
• ledger headers  
• protocol headers  
• governance artifacts  

Reuse outside deliverable artifacts requires explicit declaration elsewhere.

────────────────────────────────────────
HEADER STRUCTURE (NORMATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────

All deliverable artifacts MUST include an explicit header block delimited by:

<DELIVERABLE_HEADER>
</DELIVERABLE_HEADER>

All header fields MUST appear within this block.

The deliverable body consists of all content following the closing
</DELIVERABLE_HEADER> tag.

No other markers are required to establish the header/body boundary.

────────────────────────────────────────
REQUIRED HEADER FIELDS
────────────────────────────────────────

All deliverable artifacts MUST include all of the following fields.

EMITTER  
Identifies the role or chat instance that produced the artifact.  
Encodes authorship and accountability only.

REQUESTED_BY  
Identifies the role or actor that requested production of the artifact.  
Encodes request provenance only and does not imply approval or acceptance.

ARTIFACT_FUNCTION  
Declares what the artifact is, at an identity level.  
Distinguishes specification versus instance where relevant.  
Must not encode usage, lifecycle, authority, or correctness.

ARTIFACT_FORMAT  
Declares the primary form in which the artifact is expressed.  
Sets reader and parsing expectations only.

ARTIFACT_GROUP  
Declares one or more associative group labels for discoverability.  
Groups are unordered and many-to-many.  
Grouping does not imply priority, hierarchy, or replacement.

ARTIFACT_GROUP values MUST be separated using a semicolon (`;`) delimiter.

Example:
ARTIFACT_GROUP: VIDEO_POKER_GUI; UI_OVERLAY; HAND_EVAL

The order of group values is semantically meaningless.

CREATED_IN_CONTEXT  
Declares the situational context under which the artifact was produced.  
Describes circumstances or constraints, not evaluation or outcome.  
Must not encode time, version, order, acceptance, or success.

ARTIFACT_DOMAIN

Definition:
Declares the canonical repository domain to which the artifact belongs.

Purpose:
Provides a declared, non-inferential routing input sufficient to
deterministically select the canonical repository for the artifact.

Encodes:
• Canonical repository selection

Does NOT encode:
• Authority
• Ownership
• Governance scope
• Lifecycle state
• Ordering or priority
• Enforcement
• Semantic meaning

Constraints:
• Exactly one value
• Atomic and non-composite
• Non-hierarchical
• Stable under reuse and relocation
• Must not require external context or inference to interpret

Notes:
ARTIFACT_DOMAIN is a routing selector, not a jurisdictional or governance
claim. Its sole function is to enable deterministic artifact placement
across storage systems (e.g., GitHub, local filesystems, mirrors).

────────────────────────────────────────
OPTIONAL COLLABORATION FIELD
────────────────────────────────────────

COLLABORATION  
Records a contributing collaborator and the context of their contribution.

This field is OPTIONAL and MAY appear zero or more times.

Value format:
COLLABORATION: <NAME> FREE-FORM CONTEXT TEXT

Where:
• `<NAME>` identifies the collaborating role, chat, or entity
• All text following the closing `>` is free-form descriptive context

Example:
COLLABORATION: <UI_BASE_LAYOUT_CHAT> INITIAL GEOMETRY PASS
COLLABORATION: <ENGINEERING_REVIEW_CHAT> CONSTRAINT VALIDATION

Rules:
• Each COLLABORATION entry is independent  
• Order carries no semantic meaning  
• The field does NOT imply joint emission, approval, authority, or ownership  
• The field records contribution context only  

────────────────────────────────────────
LEGACY COMPATIBILITY
────────────────────────────────────────

Artifacts created prior to adoption of the explicit header block may omit
the <DELIVERABLE_HEADER> / </DELIVERABLE_HEADER> delimiters.

For such artifacts:
• The header is interpreted as the contiguous block of header fields at
  the beginning of the artifact.
• Legacy markers such as <DELIVERABLE HEADER>, <END HEADER>, or
  <DELIVERABLE BODY BEGINS HERE> may be used to aid human interpretation.
• Absence of explicit header delimiters does not invalidate legacy artifacts.

All newly created deliverable artifacts MUST use the explicit header block.

────────────────────────────────────────
INVARIANTS
────────────────────────────────────────

• All required header fields are mandatory  
• No header field may imply authority, lifecycle, or ordering  
• Header values must remain truthful under reuse and reinterpretation  
• Group delimiter choice carries no semantic meaning beyond separation  
• COLLABORATION entries are descriptive and non-authoritative  

────────────────────────────────────────
NON-GOALS
────────────────────────────────────────

This specification does not define:
• canonization  
• acceptance  
• versioning  
• rollback  
• workflow  
• enforcement  

────────────────────────────────────────
VALUE STYLE GUIDANCE (NON-NORMATIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────

This section provides recommended conventions for populating deliverable
header fields. These conventions improve consistency and readability but
do not impose semantic meaning, authority, or enforcement.

Deviation from these conventions is permitted where clarity requires it.

----------------------------------------
General Principles
----------------------------------------

• Standardize shape, not meaning  
• Prefer human-readable values over codes  
• Avoid numbers, ordering, or lifecycle terms  
• Avoid words that evaluate, judge, or imply status  
• Treat all values as descriptive facts, not signals  

----------------------------------------
Field-Specific Guidance
----------------------------------------

EMITTER  
• Record the role or chat name exactly as it existed at the time of artifact creation  
• Preserve capitalization, spelling, and wording as originally used  
• Do not retroactively update values to reflect later renaming or restructuring  
• Treat the value as historical provenance, not a canonical directory entry  

REQUESTED_BY  
• Record the requesting role or actor exactly as it existed at the time the request was made  
• Preserve original capitalization, spelling, and wording  
• Do not update values to reflect later role, title, or authority changes  
• Treat the value as request provenance, not endorsement or approval  

ARTIFACT_FUNCTION  
• Use ALL CAPS with underscore separation  
• Use noun phrases  
• Describe what the artifact is, not what it does  
• Avoid lifecycle, status, or preference language  

ARTIFACT_FORMAT  
• Use ALL CAPS with underscore separation  
• Single-word values are acceptable  
• Multi-word values must use underscores  
• Describe the dominant form of expression, not the tool or lifecycle  

ARTIFACT_GROUP  
• Use ALL CAPS with underscore separation for group names  
• Separate multiple group values using semicolons (`;`)  
• Treat groups as unordered labels  
• Avoid hierarchy or implied priority  

CREATED_IN_CONTEXT  
• Use ALL CAPS  
• Spaces are explicitly allowed  
• Underscores may be used but are not required  
• Prefer short descriptive phrases  
• Describe circumstances or constraints, not outcomes  
• Avoid numbers, phases, versions, or ordering terms  

COLLABORATION  
• Use the `<NAME>` prefix exactly as shown  
• `<NAME>` should match the collaborator identifier as used elsewhere  
• Context text may be brief or detailed  
• Do not use this field to imply approval, authority, or joint emission  

────────────────────────────────────────
CLOSING NOTE
────────────────────────────────────────

The deliverable header is a fact surface, not a decision surface.

It exists to remain truthful under reuse, reinterpretation,
disagreement, and time.
