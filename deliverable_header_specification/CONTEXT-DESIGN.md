# CONTEXT — DELIVERABLE HEADER ONTOLOGY

## TRIGGER

This design pass was triggered during evaluation of a structural invariant
governing artifact organization: one artifact per path, with exactly one
associated header.

While validating this invariant against existing specifications, an
implicit assumption surfaced in the Deliverable Header specification:
that deliverable headers are embedded within artifact bodies.

This assumption became visible while reasoning about directory-scoped
artifacts, fixed header filenames, and the requirement that artifact
bodies remain opaque to tooling and orchestration.

At that point, it became clear that the Deliverable Header specification
describes an embedded-header model that is incompatible with the
emerging artifact ontology, necessitating a scoped design review.
