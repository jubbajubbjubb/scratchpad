THOUGHT CAPTURE — FORM / GRAMMAR GAP
────────────────────────────────────────

Purpose:
Capture the emerging reasoning around naming, form, and grammar so it
can be externalized, debated, and iterated without relying on memory.

This is NOT a specification.
This is a thought capture for later refinement.

────────────────────────────────────────
1. PROBLEM STATEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────

Humans invent names, identifiers, and labels.
Machines must consume artifacts without inference.

Historically, naming has silently carried extra responsibilities:
• signaling intent
• signaling importance
• encoding lifecycle
• hinting at behavior or authority

This is dangerous in a machine-first system, because machines must treat
names as opaque.

The core problem is not naming itself.
The core problem is preventing semantic smuggling via form.

────────────────────────────────────────
2. ESTABLISHED FACTS / INVARIANTS
────────────────────────────────────────

• Headers define what exists.
• Placement grammar defines where it goes.
• Neither should rely on human memory.
• Humans should not have to remember why a name is “bad.”
• If a rule exists only in conversation, it does not exist.

These are settled constraints.

────────────────────────────────────────
3. OBSERVED FRICTION / SIGNALS
────────────────────────────────────────

Repeated signals indicating a missing formal boundary:

• “This feels wrong but I can’t justify it cleanly.”
• “I hate that I have to remember this.”
• “This keeps turning into a semantic debate.”
• “We already solved this, but I don’t know where.”

These signals indicate a missing artifact governing FORM.

Not placement.
Not identity.
FORM.

────────────────────────────────────────
4. WHY THE TERM ‘GRAMMAR’ KEEPS RECURRING
────────────────────────────────────────

The concept under discussion has the following properties:

• Defines admissible vs inadmissible forms
• Does not assign meaning
• Does not grant authority
• Is non-negotiable once written
• Is mechanically checkable
• Violations are “ill-formed,” not “wrong”

Operationally, this matches the definition of a grammar.

Discomfort with the term appears to be about weight or connotation,
not correctness.

────────────────────────────────────────
5. SINGLE GRAMMAR VS MULTIPLE GRAMMARS
────────────────────────────────────────

Multiple grammars would imply:
• humans must remember which grammar applies
• boundary disputes between grammars
• drift back to interpretation

A single grammar implies:
• if a value is human-chosen, the grammar applies
• one place where form is decided
• no memory burden

Symmetry with existing structure:
• One header structure
• One placement grammar
• One form grammar

────────────────────────────────────────
6. WHAT THE GRAMMAR WOULD GOVERN
────────────────────────────────────────

Applies to the FORM of human-chosen strings, including:

• ARTIFACT_ID
• ARTIFACT_FUNCTION
• ARTIFACT_GROUP values
• any future human-invented identifiers

Defines:
• forbidden tokens (e.g., FINAL, V2, CANONICAL)
• forbidden semantics (authority, lifecycle, ordering)
• allowed character classes
• stability expectations

Does NOT define:
• placement
• authority
• correctness of content
• behavior
• acceptance

────────────────────────────────────────
7. WHY THIS FEELS LIKE EXTRA WORK
────────────────────────────────────────

The grammar already exists implicitly in human memory.

That is the worst possible storage location.

Externalizing it:
• reduces debate
• reduces future friction
• reduces emotional load
• allows safe forgetting

This mirrors prior successful externalizations:
• invariants
• headers
• routing
• shibboleths

────────────────────────────────────────
8. OPEN QUESTIONS FOR ITERATION
────────────────────────────────────────

(To be debated later; not resolved here.)

1. Is “GRAMMAR” the right artifact function name, or should it be scoped?
2. Should the grammar be purely prohibitive, or also define allowed forms?
3. How strict should it be on human readability vs machine safety?
4. Does it apply retroactively or only prospectively?
5. Where is the boundary between grammar and non-normative style guidance?

────────────────────────────────────────
9. CLOSING NOTE
────────────────────────────────────────

This capture exists because reliance on memory was detected.

The goal is to convert “I hate that I have to remember this” into
a single authoritative artifact so remembering is no longer required.

Next steps: debate, refine, compress into a normative grammar artifact.
