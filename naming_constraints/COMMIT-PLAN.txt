# Commit Plan — FILE_DIRECTORY_NAMING_GRAMMAR Reconciliation

This plan consists of **atomic, self-contained commits**.
Each commit may be safely re-run if partial application or cleanup is required.
No commit introduces new concepts or expands scope.

Commits are ordered for dependency sanity, not narrative flow.

---

## COMMIT 1 — REMOVE DERIVATION SEMANTICS FROM NAMING GRAMMAR

**Intent**
Eliminate all derivation, lineage, or process-related semantics from the grammar.

**Actions**
- Delete the entire “Derived Artifact Naming” section.
- Remove all references to:
  - base ARTIFACT_ID preservation
  - derivation markers
  - process encoding
  - identity continuity via filename shape

**Success Check**
- The grammar contains no references to derivation, lineage, or process.
- Filenames are governed strictly as standalone forms.

---

## COMMIT 2 — PURGE IDENTITY-IMPLYING LANGUAGE

**Intent**
Ensure filenames are never interpretable as identity carriers.

**Actions**
- Remove or rephrase any sentence implying that:
  - names identify artifacts
  - collisions imply identity conflict
  - names “claim” identity or function
- Replace such language with purely structural phrasing
  (e.g., “structural conflict”, “invalid state”).

**Success Check**
- Identity is never attributed to names.
- All identity references defer implicitly or explicitly to `IDENTITY.txt`.

---

## COMMIT 3 — REMOVE HEADER-ERA ASSUMPTIONS

**Intent**
Eliminate residual assumptions from the deliverable-header era.

**Actions**
- Remove language that presumes:
  - embedded headers
  - filename-based identity
  - implicit provenance from paths
- Ensure all references to metadata defer to explicit artifacts governed elsewhere.

**Success Check**
- The document is coherent without knowledge of headers.
- No concept relies on filename-embedded metadata.

---

## COMMIT 4 — TIGHTEN GRAMMAR VS PLACEMENT BOUNDARY

**Intent**
Make the grammar/placement separation unambiguous and non-overlapping.

**Actions**
- Remove or rephrase any language implying:
  - routing
  - repository semantics
  - placement outcomes
- Ensure all placement mentions are strictly delegative (“governed elsewhere”).

**Success Check**
- Grammar validity is decidable without knowing file location.
- Placement rules cannot be inferred from this spec.

---

## COMMIT 5 — CONVERT DEFENSIVE PROSE INTO STRUCTURAL RULES

**Intent**
Replace cautionary language with binary structural outcomes.

**Actions**
- Remove explanatory warnings aimed at preventing misuse.
- Retain only:
  - mandatory rules
  - explicit failure conditions
- Express invalidity as structural failure, not behavioral error.

**Success Check**
- The spec reads as executable constraints, not advice.
- No paragraph exists solely to warn or persuade.

---

## COMMIT 6 — MECHANICAL DECIDABILITY PASS

**Intent**
Guarantee all rules are mechanically checkable.

**Actions**
- Review every MUST / MUST NOT rule for:
  - interpretability without context
  - decidability via direct application
- Remove or rewrite any rule requiring judgment, intent, or inference.

**Success Check**
- A machine can validate a name using only this document.
- Ambiguity is defined strictly as undecidability.

---

## COMMIT 7 — TERMINOLOGY NORMALIZATION

**Intent**
Align terminology with the rest of the governance corpus.

**Actions**
- Normalize terms to match:
  - identity specs
  - placement specs
  - invariant language
- Eliminate casual reuse of terms with different meanings elsewhere
  (e.g., identity, function, authority).

**Success Check**
- No term conflicts semantically with its usage in other canonical specs.
- Identical concepts use identical language.

---

## COMMIT 8 — FAILURE SEMANTICS CONSOLIDATION

**Intent**
Preserve loud, correct failure behavior without redundancy.

**Actions**
- Consolidate repeated failure rules where possible.
- Ensure all invalid states:
  - halt execution
  - permit no fallback
  - require explicit correction
- Remove duplicate restatements that do not add constraint.

**Success Check**
- Failure semantics are strict, explicit, and non-repetitive.
- No permissive or recovery language remains.

---

## COMMIT 9 — FINAL COHERENCE & ONTOLOGY CHECK

**Intent**
Validate internal consistency after reconciliation.

**Actions**
- Verify:
  - no orphaned concepts remain
  - no deleted semantics are indirectly referenced
  - section ordering still makes sense
- Make no semantic changes.

**Success Check**
- The document is internally consistent and ontologically clean.
- All sections reinforce the same model.

---

## COMMIT 10 — FORMATTING & READABILITY PASS

**Intent**
Improve presentation only.

**Actions**
- Normalize spacing, section breaks, and headings.
- Improve readability without changing meaning.

**Success Check**
- No semantic diff exists.
- Remaining discussion is about location, not meaning.

---

## END STATE

At completion:
- The spec governs **name form only**
- Identity is exclusively declared in `IDENTITY.txt`
- Placement is governed elsewhere
- All rules are mechanically checkable
- Failure is loud, binary, and correct
- The document is boring, strict, and inevitable
