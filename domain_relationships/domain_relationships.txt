NON-AUTHORITATIVE MEMO
Purpose: Propose and justify two governance artifacts required to define
         domain containment and domain relationships.
Status: Informational only. Not binding. Not canonical.
Audience: Future governance-authoritative chat (e.g., another ZERO instance)
Scope: Logical scaffolding and artifact proposals only.

────────────────────────────────────────
BACKGROUND CONTEXT
────────────────────────────────────────

The system distinguishes between:

• Structural axioms (rules that must always be true)
• Registries (records of what is currently true)

Earlier confusion arose from attempting to encode both concepts in a
single artifact. This memo separates them explicitly.

Key realization:
Domain containment and domain relationships are different categories of fact
and therefore require different artifact types.

────────────────────────────────────────
ARTIFACT PROPOSAL 1
────────────────────────────────────────

Name (proposed):
CORE_DOMAIN_CONTAINMENT_POLICY

Artifact Class:
GOVERNANCE / POLICY (structural, axiomatic)

Purpose:
Declare the universal containment rule that governs all domains.

Logical Justification:

• CORE is the foundational domain.
• All other domains exist only within CORE validity.
• CORE invariants apply to every domain, regardless of domain hierarchy.
• This rule must hold even if:
  – no domains are registered
  – the domain registry is empty
  – the domain registry changes over time

Therefore:
This rule must NOT be expressed as a registry entry and must NOT depend
on enumerated domains.

What This Artifact Declares:

• All domains are subsets of CORE.
• No domain exists outside CORE validity.
• CORE invariants apply universally.

What This Artifact Does NOT Do:

• Does not list domains.
• Does not encode relationships between non-core domains.
• Does not change as domains are added, removed, or renamed.

Reason This Must Be Its Own Artifact:

• Treats containment as law, not data.
• Prevents accidental invalidation through registry edits.
• Allows registries to evolve without undermining foundational validity.

────────────────────────────────────────
ARTIFACT PROPOSAL 2
────────────────────────────────────────

Name (proposed):
DOMAIN_RELATIONSHIP_REGISTRY

Artifact Class:
GOVERNANCE / REGISTRY (descriptive, mutable)

Purpose:
Maintain an explicit record of declared domains and their relationships.

Logical Justification:

• Domains are created, modified, and deprecated over time.
• Relationships between domains are not axiomatic; they are factual.
• An orchestrator must be able to discover:
  – which domains exist
  – how domains relate (parent, peer, subdomain)
• These facts must be:
  – explicit
  – inspectable
  – versioned through commits

Therefore:
Domain relationships must be recorded in a mutable registry artifact.

What This Artifact Declares:

• The existence of domains.
• The relationships between domains (e.g., parent-child).
• The current topology of domains within CORE.

What This Artifact Does NOT Do:

• Does not define CORE.
• Does not grant authority.
• Does not define invariant semantics.
• Does not override CORE containment.

Reason This Must Be Separate from CORE Containment:

• Allows domain topology to evolve safely.
• Prevents registry edits from affecting foundational rules.
• Keeps axioms stable and registries flexible.

────────────────────────────────────────
INTENDED SYSTEM BEHAVIOR
────────────────────────────────────────

An orchestrator or governance agent uses:

• CORE_DOMAIN_CONTAINMENT_POLICY
  to answer validity questions:
  “Does this domain fall under CORE rules?”

• DOMAIN_RELATIONSHIP_REGISTRY
  to answer topology questions:
  “What domains exist and how do they relate?”

No inference between these artifacts is permitted.
Each serves a distinct, non-overlapping purpose.

────────────────────────────────────────
RATIONALE FOR SEPARATION
────────────────────────────────────────

Combining these artifacts would:

• Collapse axioms into data
• Make foundational rules mutable
• Force inference where declaration is required

Separating them ensures:

• Stability of foundational constraints
• Safe evolution of domain topology
• Clear reasoning boundaries for humans and machines
