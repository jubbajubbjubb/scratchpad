Interpretive Notes (Non-Normative)
────────────────────────────────────────

• AUTHORITY_POLICY answers questions of *standing*.
  It determines whether an action can exist at all.

• POLICY answers questions of *execution*.
  It determines whether an allowed action was performed correctly.

• AUTHORITY_POLICY operates before behavior.
• POLICY operates during or after behavior.

• AUTHORITY_POLICY failures are existential.
• POLICY failures are procedural.

• POLICY is meaningless without pre-existing authority.
• AUTHORITY_POLICY is meaningful even in the absence of action.

────────────────────────────────────────
Usage Guidance (Informational)
────────────────────────────────────────

When confused about classification, ask:

1. “Is this deciding who may act?”
   → AUTHORITY_POLICY

2. “Is this deciding how an allowed act is performed?”
   → POLICY

If both seem true, the artifact is likely improperly conflated
and should be split rather than debated.
