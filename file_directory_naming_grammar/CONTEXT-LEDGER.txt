## Goals for Fixing the FILE_DIRECTORY_NAMING_GRAMMAR Specification

### 1. Align the Spec with the Artifact Identity Model
- Remove all assumptions that identity is implicit in filenames or paths.
- Ensure the grammar governs **form only**, never identity.
- Guarantee compatibility with `IDENTITY.txt` as the sole source of artifact identity.

**Success condition:**  
A reader cannot mistake naming grammar as a carrier of identity, provenance, or authority.

---

### 2. Eliminate Residual Header-Era Semantics
- Remove or neutralize any language that assumes embedded headers, inferred identity, or filename-as-identity behavior.
- Ensure all references that previously depended on “deliverable headers” now clearly defer to explicit artifacts (e.g., identity records, placement specs).

**Success condition:**  
No concept in the document requires knowledge of a header-based world to remain coherent.

---

### 3. Tighten Grammar vs Placement Boundaries
- Reaffirm that this spec governs **admissible form only**.
- Remove or rephrase any language that even indirectly implies placement, routing, or repository semantics.
- Ensure all placement-related references are strictly delegative (“governed elsewhere”) and non-operational here.

**Success condition:**  
Grammar validity can be determined without knowing *where* a file lives.

---

### 4. Replace Defensive Language with Structural Certainty
- Remove prose that exists solely to warn against misuse that is now structurally impossible.
- Preserve all failure modes, but express them as **binary structural outcomes**, not behavioral cautions.

**Success condition:**  
The spec reads as mechanical rules, not as a lecture to future humans or LLMs.

---

### 5. Ensure Mechanical Checkability End-to-End
- Every rule must be decidable by direct application of the grammar.
- No rule may require interpretation, intent inference, or contextual judgment.
- Ambiguity must be defined only as *mechanical undecidability*.

**Success condition:**  
A machine can validate or reject a name without consulting anything except this spec.

---

### 6. Maintain Ontological Consistency Across the Corpus
- Terminology must match other canonical specs (identity, placement, invariants).
- Identical concepts must use identical language; distinct concepts must not share words casually.

**Success condition:**  
No term in this document conflicts semantically with its usage elsewhere.

---

### 7. Preserve Loud, Correct Failure Semantics
- All invalid states must halt execution.
- No fallback, recovery, or permissive interpretation may be implied.
- Failure is a system state, not an error of intent.

**Success condition:**  
The spec never allows the system to “guess and continue.”

---

### 8. End in Boredom, Not Brilliance
- The finished spec should feel inevitable, strict, and unexciting.
- Remaining edits should be formatting-only.

**Success condition:**  
Further discussion shifts from “what does this mean?” to “where does this live?”

---

### Closing Constraint
No change made to this specification may:
- Introduce new concepts
- Expand scope
- Add authority
- Soften failure semantics

All fixes are **reconciliation**, not invention.

### Goals for FILE_DIRECTORY_NAMING_GRAMMAR (post-decision)

- Govern **name form only**, not meaning, identity, or lineage
- Eliminate all derivation- or process-related semantics
- Preserve strict, mechanically checkable constraints
- Avoid introducing any shadow identity or inference surface
- Ensure the grammar remains complete and self-sufficient
