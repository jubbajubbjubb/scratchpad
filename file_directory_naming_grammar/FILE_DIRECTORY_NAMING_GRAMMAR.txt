FILE_DIRECTORY_NAMING_GRAMMAR
────────────────────────────────────────

────────────────────────────────────────
PURPOSE
────────────────────────────────────────

This specification defines a formal grammar governing the admissible
form of names used for files and directories.

The purpose of this grammar is to prevent semantic smuggling via form
by constraining naming to mechanically checkable structure that does
not assign meaning, authority, lifecycle, or intent.

────────────────────────────────────────
SCOPE & APPLICABILITY
────────────────────────────────────────

This specification governs the admissible form of names assigned to
files and directories.

This grammar applies equally and without distinction to:
• file names
• directory names

All names that exist within governed repositories MUST conform to this
specification.

This specification governs form only.
It MUST NOT be used to infer or define placement, identity, authority,
behavior, acceptance, or correctness of artifact content.

────────────────────────────────────────
STABILITY & RENAME SEMANTICS
────────────────────────────────────────

Names governed by this specification are presumed immutable.

A rename is an exceptional event and MUST be treated as a first-class
change requiring an explicit commit.

Any rename MUST update the associated deliverable header.
Any path change constitutes an explicit file or directory move.

There is no concept of a cosmetic or harmless rename.
Renames and moves are governance-relevant events with provenance.

────────────────────────────────────────
SEMANTIC CONSTRAINTS
────────────────────────────────────────

Names governed by this specification MUST NOT encode semantic meaning
belonging to any of the following disallowed classes:

• Lifecycle semantics
  (including but not limited to: FINAL, DRAFT, DEPRECATED)

• Authority semantics
  (including but not limited to: CANONICAL, OFFICIAL)

• Ordering or versioning semantics
  (including but not limited to: V1, V2, NEXT)

• Evaluative semantics
  (including but not limited to: GOOD, BAD, CORRECT)

No other semantic restrictions apply.

Any semantic content not belonging to the explicitly disallowed classes
above is permitted.

This grammar is purely prohibitive.
It does not prescribe meaning, intent, hierarchy, importance, or usage.

────────────────────────────────────────
CHARACTER SET & SHAPE GRAMMAR
────────────────────────────────────────

Names governed by this specification MUST conform to the following
character set, casing, and length constraints.

Character Set and Casing:

• Names MUST consist solely of ASCII uppercase letters A–Z and
  underscore characters (`_`).
• All alphabetic characters MUST be uppercase.
• No other characters are permitted.

Length Constraints:

• Names MUST be at least 3 characters in length.
• Names MUST NOT exceed 64 characters in length.
• Underscore characters are excluded from length calculations.

These constraints are mandatory and mechanically checkable.

Derived Artifact Naming:

Derived artifacts MUST preserve the base ARTIFACT_ID verbatim and
append a derivation marker using a double underscore delimiter.

The canonical pattern for derived artifacts is:

<ARTIFACT_ID>__<derivation>.<extension>

Rules for derivation markers:

• The base ARTIFACT_ID MUST be preserved exactly.
• Derivation markers MUST be lowercase.
• Derivation markers MUST encode process only.
• Derivation markers MUST NOT encode versioning, ordering, lifecycle,
  authority, or evaluative semantics.

Derived artifacts MUST NOT alter the canonical identity of the base
artifact.

────────────────────────────────────────
FILE EXTENSIONS & ARTIFACT_FORMAT
────────────────────────────────────────

File extensions are not part of the governed name under this specification.

The grammar defined in this document governs only the base name
(i.e., the identifier portion preceding any file extension).

File extensions exist solely as a serialization indicator and
correspond to the value declared in the ARTIFACT_FORMAT field of the
deliverable header.

Normative rules:

• File extensions MUST NOT be treated as part of the artifact’s identity.
• File extensions MUST NOT be used to infer authority, lifecycle,
  ordering, evaluation, or semantic meaning.
• File extensions MUST NOT be interpreted as carrying meaning beyond
  the declared ARTIFACT_FORMAT.
• This specification DOES NOT prescribe, restrict, or prohibit any
  specific file extension.
• Validation of correspondence between ARTIFACT_FORMAT and file
  extension, if any, is out of scope for this specification.

Tooling, automation, and LLMs MUST treat file extensions as
non-authoritative representations of format and MUST rely on
ARTIFACT_FORMAT as the sole declarative source of format information.

────────────────────────────────────────
NORMATIVE LANGUAGE
────────────────────────────────────────

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, and “MAY” in this document are used to
indicate normative requirements.

Normative statements are binding.
All other text is explanatory and non-normative.

────────────────────────────────────────
MIGRATION & LEGACY
────────────────────────────────────────

There is no legacy exemption under this specification.

All pre-existing files and directories MUST be updated to conform to
this grammar in order to exist within governed repositories.

Migration consists solely of normalization to the current specification.
There is no compatibility mode and no grandfathering.

Any file or directory that does not conform is not admissible.
