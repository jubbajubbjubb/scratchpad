FILE_DIRECTORY_NAMING_GRAMMAR
────────────────────────────────────────

────────────────────────────────────────
PURPOSE
────────────────────────────────────────

This specification defines a formal grammar governing the admissible
form of names used for files and directories.

The purpose of this grammar is to prevent semantic smuggling via form
by constraining naming to mechanically checkable structure that does
not assign meaning, authority, lifecycle, or intent.

────────────────────────────────────────
SCOPE & APPLICABILITY
────────────────────────────────────────

This specification governs the admissible form of names assigned to
files and directories.

This grammar applies equally and without distinction to:
• file names
• directory names

All names that exist within governed repositories MUST conform to this
specification.

This specification governs form only.
It MUST NOT be used to infer or define placement, identity, authority,
behavior, acceptance, or correctness of artifact content.

────────────────────────────────────────
STABILITY & RENAME SEMANTICS
────────────────────────────────────────

Names governed by this specification are presumed immutable.

A rename is an exceptional event and MUST be treated as a first-class
change requiring an explicit commit.

Any rename MUST update the associated deliverable header.
Any path change constitutes an explicit file or directory move.

There is no concept of a cosmetic or harmless rename.
Renames and moves are governance-relevant events with provenance.

────────────────────────────────────────
NORMATIVE LANGUAGE
────────────────────────────────────────

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, and “MAY” in this document are used to
indicate normative requirements.

Normative statements are binding.
All other text is explanatory and non-normative.

────────────────────────────────────────
MIGRATION & LEGACY
────────────────────────────────────────

There is no legacy exemption under this specification.

All pre-existing files and directories MUST be updated to conform to
this grammar in order to exist within governed repositories.

Migration consists solely of normalization to the current specification.
There is no compatibility mode and no grandfathering.

Any file or directory that does not conform is not admissible.
